# Password Manager GUI

![Java Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-8%2B-blue)
![Swing](https://img.shields.io/badge/swing-GUI-orange)

This is a simple password manager graphical user interface (GUI) application built in Java using the Swing library. It allows users to add and manage their account credentials securely.

## Features

- Add new accounts with usernames and passwords.
- Authenticate users by checking entered credentials.
- Provides visual feedback through dialogs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher is required to run this application.
- Make sure you have a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager-gui.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Usage

1. Compile and run the `PasswordManagerGUI.java` file.
2. The GUI application window will open, providing two fields for username and password, and buttons for adding an account and logging in.
3. To add a new account, enter the username and password, and click the "Add Account" button.
4. To log in, enter the username and password, and click the "Login" button. You will receive feedback on the success or failure of your login attempt.

## How it Works

The Password Manager GUI uses Java's Swing library to create a user-friendly interface. It employs a simple map to store account information (username as the key and password as the value). Here's a basic overview of the code structure:

- `PasswordManagerGUI.java`: The main application class containing the GUI components, event listeners, and the main method to launch the application.
- `accounts`: A `Map` object to store username-password pairs.
- `addButton` and `loginButton` ActionListeners: These listeners handle the addition of new accounts and authentication, respectively.
- When an account is added, the entered username and password are stored in the `accounts` map.
- During login, the entered username and password are checked against the stored credentials. If they match, a successful login message is shown; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
